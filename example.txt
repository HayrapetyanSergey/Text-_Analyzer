If the border of the metropolis is well defined, its internal structure is immensely 
complicated and defies description. Indeed, Londonâ€™s defining characteristic is an absence 
of overall form. It is physically a polycentric city, with many core districts and no clear 
hierarchy among them. London has at least two (and sometimes many more) of everything: 
cities, mayors, dioceses, cathedrals, chambers of commerce, police forces, opera houses, 
orchestras, and universities. In every aspect it functions as a compound or confederal 
metropolis.
